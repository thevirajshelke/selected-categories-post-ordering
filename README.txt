== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin all about? =

WordPress will show the post on the site in a specific order which is newest first. In most of the cases this
ordering is great! But say for example I have a specific categories of posts like "XYZ Tutorials" where I don't
want the post in the newest first order! Rather I would prefer it in the cronological order so that user finds it easy
to follow. This could be acheived by modifying some code in the WordPress queries but that's tricky! So I came up with
a simple plugin which when you install can change the order of specific category post to cronological. All you have to 
do is just mention the categories in the settings page.
