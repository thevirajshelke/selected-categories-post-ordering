Simple plugin to change the order of your posts for selected categories! Posts of selected categories will be displayed in chronological order.

== Description ==

Simple plugin to change the order of your posts to chronological for selected categories! Posts of selected categories will be displayed in chronological order instead of reverse-chronological.
This can be useful for sites that have some tutorials, historical content (which is to be displayed in the order it was published), journals, books, etc. where the content is intended to be shown chronologically, along with some other regular posts where we need the order to default i.e. reverse-chronological.
So if your site needs to display some posts in chronological order and some in reverse-chronological this plugin is for you. All you need to do is just segregate the posts into categories & install this plugin!

== Installation ==

1. Take the easy route and install through the WordPress plugin installer, or,
2. Download the .zip file and upload the unzipped folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
3. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
4. Go to Selected Categories Post Ordering settings and check the categories whose posts order you want to change.
